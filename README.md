As a first-timer using GitHub, 
I’ve found it a little overwhelming at first, 
but I find it super useful once you understand its functions.
At first, I didn’t really understand all the terminology, 
like “commit,” “pull,” or “clone,” but after watching a few lectures, 
it started to make more sense. 
It’s a bit like a cloud-based folder where you can save all your files and easily keep track of changes
which is a huge plus for developers and designers out there that tend to make a lot of updates to projects.
In the future I feel like I would use this platform on both personal and a professional level 
Github is something you can't argue about not having or there are better alternatives
As it's complicated when you first start understanding the site but in my opinion it necessary to have at your deposal  
As it can help you land a job by showing publicly showing your projects on the site to inpress employers
And also, once understood it can be most important collaboration tool with many developers and designers on certain projects you want to achieve.
